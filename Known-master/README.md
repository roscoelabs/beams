##Installation [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/idno/Known.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/idno/Known)

###One-click Known sites

A fully-managed hosted service is provided at <https://withknown.com/>. It is always kept up to date with the latest
version of Known.

Known is also tested to work with the following hosts:

* [Reclaim Hosting](https://portal.reclaimhosting.com/aff.php?aff=013)
* [Arvixe](http://www.arvixe.com/9014-443-3-367.html)

###Self-hosting

Known is under active development and requires PHP 5.4+ with selected extensions, together with a supported database backend.

If you are installing Known for use on your own website, we HIGHLY recommend using the installable packages
from <https://withknown.com/opensource>. Installation will be much easier!

You can also opt to check out the bleeding edge code from the git repository: <https://github.com/idno/Known>

Either way, you should read the detailed installation instructions: <http://docs.withknown.com/en/latest/install/index.html>
