# Known Documentation

[Known](https://withknown.com)  is an open publishing and collaboration platform that allows anyone to share their stories using many types of media. Whether you are publishing as a group, or just as an individual, Known allows you to post to a site that you really own, while reaching your audience wherever they might be.

This is the canonical documentation for the project.
