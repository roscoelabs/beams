# System requirements

Known _requires_ the following server components:

+ A Web Server that supports URL rewriting (Apache + mod_rewrite recommended)
+ If you are using Apache, you also need to make sure support for .htaccess is enabled (using [the AllowOverride All directive](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EnablingUseOfApacheHtaccessFiles)).
+ PHP 5.4 or above
+ MongoDB, MySQL 5 or SQLite3

Known must be installed at the root of a domain, and does not currently support subdirectory installations. It does support subdomains, however.

If you use Apache 2.4, you either must install and activate:

* mod_access_compat (see [http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_access_compat.html](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_access_compat.html))

Or manually edit Known’s stock .htaccess file by replacing:

    <Files ~ "\.ini$">
    Order allow,deny
    Deny from all
    </Files>
    <Files ~ "\.xml$">
    Order allow,deny
    Deny from all
    </Files>

with:

    <Files ~ "\.ini$">
    Require all denied
    </Files>
    <Files ~ "\.xml$">
    Require all denied
    </Files>

Additionally, Known requires the following PHP components:

+ curl
+ date
+ dom
+ gd
+ json
+ libxml
+ mbstring
+ mongo or mysql (depending on database backend)
+ reflection
+ session
+ xmlrpc

Note that you may need to restart the web server after installing these components. Known’s installer will tell you if a required module isn’t available.

## Recommendations

Known _recommends_ the following extra server components:

+ Linux or UNIX-based server
+ A PHP accelerator like eAccelerator
+ A secure certificate (so connections to Known can be made secure)
+ A server cache like Squid
