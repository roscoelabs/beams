# Open source community

Known is an open source application. That means that you have the following freedoms:

* The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose.
* The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
* The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor.
* The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others. By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.

There were originally defined by [Richard Stallman of the Free Software Foundation](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html).

## Contributing to Known

Known is made with the participation of our grassroots open source community.

If you're a developer, you can check out our [GitHub project](https://github.com/idno/known), but open source shouldn't just
be for developers! If you're a designer, a writer, a translator or just someone who wants to help, you should feel welcome
to come join in.

The best first step is to [join our development mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/known-dev). Despite
the name, it's not just for developers!

## A safe space for everyone to contribute

We want the Known community to be a safe space for everyone to participate.

As such, we have an [anti-harassment policy](harassment.md) that covers all our community spaces. A healthy communicate
is required to make Known thrive, so we're dedicated to making it as welcoming as possible.

If you have any concerns about any activity in the community, you shouldn't hesitate to
[get in touch with a member of the team](harassment.md##get-in-touch-with-the-core-team). We promise to deal with it
sensitively and discretely.
